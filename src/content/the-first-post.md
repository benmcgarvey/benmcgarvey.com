Welcome to the first post in my Blog!

## Why start a blog?

I want to start a blog because I want to have a place to call my own on the internet. A place where I can do whatever I like. It's a place to share things I've learnt, things I've done or things that I think are interesting. In a longer and more flexible format than a twitter account. 

As an engineer a handmade blog is especially exciting because it's something which I can craft using the skills of my trade. It's sort of like a personal workshop. It's a place where I can practice my craft, hone my skills, or experiment and try out new things. There are no consequences, no customers, no deadlines.

## A single journey starts with one step

When I decided to start a blog I had high hopes for it's hosting and design. Like I said, it's a playground! I wanted everything handmade. A micro-cms, full hosting (think S3, mongoDB, lambda) a lightweight frontend, markdown rendering, all rolled up with snazzy CI etc etc...

I messed around with this for a few weeks before realising I'd lost sight of what I was doing. Most importantly, I wanted a blog. My wildly ambitious spec requirements were distracting me and I was no closer to having somewhere to actually write. I decided to get an MVP up and work on it from there.

Version 1 is a lightly adjusted [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template ([hugo-theme-basic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/)) hosted with [render.com](https://render.com/). Getting it up and running was a handful of commands.

[EDIT] _Version 2 is now up! You're looking at it!_

_V2 is designed and written by me using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Svelte is a lightweight frontend js framework which promises lots of the features found in other frameworks like React.js or Vue, at a fraction of the build size, whilst providing better speed and reactivity to the end user._

_I like things which are small, simple and effective. Which is why I like svelte, and why I chose it for my site._

## What's in a name?

The final note for this intro blog is to mention the name, "failing-gracefully". 

I didn't choose it just for the cool pun. Only _partially._ It's a goal: fail, gracefully.

In my opinion, Failure is necessary and expected in the pursuit of anything. Failure should be embraced and welcomed. It's an invaluable opportunity to learn and develop character. 

Learning how to fail, and how to recover from failure is essential to both being a good developer, and a good human. I hope this blog reflects that.
